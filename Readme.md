Name: ReCreate an Etsy Page

Description: This is a recreation of an Etsy page with the search listing "Atlanta Braves."  All of the HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery was created from nothing.  I also was introduced to working with API's and one of the main deliverables was to pull the data from the API's, use jQuery to throw it onto the page, and have it automatically styled with CSS.  It was a great exercise and really helped solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS and opened my eyes as to how to work with API's and the importance of an easy to work with API.

Additionally, this was the first project using our new application build methods.  We used Gulp, Node Package Manager, and Bower to scaffold the project.

How to Use it:
	Clone my repo
	run npm install
	run bower install

Libraries Used: 
	Basic JS
	jQuery
	Sass

Go Braves!
