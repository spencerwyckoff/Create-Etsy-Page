If you purchase more than one of my items I will try to combine shipping and refund overage if it is items that will easily fit in one package. Sometimes that is not possible because of the unusual vintage items I sell. most of my items have shipping estimates that are based on fees from here (east coast) to the west coast. I do refund overages after I print my label if the item ships for much less then estimated. \r\n For International shipping please email me for a quote if you need a combined fee for more than one item.  I ship to the USA and internationally although I prefer to quote the shipping to your location on some items requiring a box.   All my shipments inside the USA  have tracking  I am not able to track first class  Items once they have left the USA and it will be up to you to locate any package that does not arrive in a timely manner by using the customs number unless a  customs form is not required.  The buyer is responsible for any taxes or custom fees charged by the country the item is delivered to.  Because of the varied shipping fees from one country to another shipping  will sometimes be less then charged.  I will refund shipping overage minus my handling fees.  \r\n\r\nPlease email me before buying if you would like to purchased a large heavy item and are located in Hawaii or Alaska",

Contact me by email  if you are considering returning an item.\r\n\r\nReturns should be made within 7 days of receipt of merchandise. Shipping cost to return the item is the responsibility of the buyer and refund of the purchase price (minus original shipping charges) will be made promptly after I have received the returned item.\r\nMost of my shipping is insured so we need to work together to make a claim if the item was damaged in transit. \r\nHowever, if the item is defective or the error is mine, a full refund or replacement, including original shipping will credit back to your payment account.\r\nI do have a bricks and mortar and treat my online customers with the same honesty and respect as the customers  I meet face to face.  \r\n\r\nThank you for visiting my etsy shop. \r\n",

When you place your order, the invoice on the order on the top right side will say &quot;Scheduled to ship by&quot; and that is the date by which your order will be handed off to USPS. It is not a delivery date. Once your order has shipped you&#39;ll receive a tracking number for it. At that point the USPS website will be able to provide a projected delivery date.\r\n\r\nInternational orders may be subject to duties/customs fees. We do not have any way to estimate these fees or pay them for you. These fees vary by country. There is no guaranteed delivery speed for international mail and international parcels can take a few weeks to arrive. Please plan accordingly if you are ordering from outside the US.\r\n\r\nWe offer both first class and priority mail options. If you select priority mail we will ship your order using USPS priority mail service. This does NOT mean we can ship your order the day after you order. All of our items are handmade to order, which is why we have a 2-5 business day window for shipping. \r\n\r\nWhen we receive priority orders we do make every effort to ship those packages as fast as we possibly can. Occasionally we can do next day shipping, but in most cases we do need at least 2-3 business days to get a priority order printed and handed off to USPS, and then USPS needs 2-3 business days to deliver the shipment. If you have a firm in-hand date you are aiming for, please contact us to verify that we can make it happen. ",
"policy_refunds": "We want you to be 100% satisfied with your order. If there are any issues please contact us, we&#39;d be happy to help you.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;d like to request a return or exchange please email or send us a message for return/exchange instructions. Generally speaking, most items are eligible for returns/exchanges. Any items that are customized or occasion-specific (birthday shirts, personalized text, Christmas shirts, etc.) may not be eligible for returns/exchanges.",
